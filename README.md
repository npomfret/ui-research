# UI Research Notes

This repo is intentionally loose: each `.md` file is its own research note about modern web UI techniques. Some are polished playbook chapters (`layered-foundations.md`, `surfaces-depth.md`, `layout-system.md`, etc.), others are experimental write-ups (e.g., `glassmorphism-research.md`, `modern-ui-libraries.md`), and everything can evolve as we learn more.

Suggested starting points (pick whatever fits your task):
- `modern_ui_ux_guide.md` — narrative map that links into the main notes.
- `anti-patterns.md` — both release blockers and legacy pitfalls in one place before you ship or when auditing older stacks.
- `glassmorphism-research.md` + `modern-ui-libraries.md` — exploratory notes when you need inspiration beyond the core guidance.
- `animation-and-microinteractions-research.md` + `motion-feedback.md` — deep dives on native scroll/view-transition APIs, implementation checklists, and QA tooling for motion-heavy work.
- `accessibility-resilience-tooling.md` — motion preference handling, HTMX hydration patterns, and the verification artifacts reviewers should request (Chromatic diffs, DevTools traces, reduced-motion captures).

No build, no strict structure—just keep adding/editing Markdown documents as discoveries happen.
