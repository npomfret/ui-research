# UI Research Notes

This repo is a living handbook for building cinematic, resilient web interfaces. Every markdown file captures hard-won patterns—tokens, motion systems, QA checklists, and research dossiers—so engineers can copy proven solutions instead of reinventing them.

Start with the [Field Guide](./field-guide.md) for a tour of the six focus areas, then jump into the folder that matches the work in front of you:

- `systems/` — design tokens, layered backgrounds, layout & surfaces, accessibility/resilience.
- `interaction/` — motion recipes, scroll/view-transition guidance, reusable content modules.
- `quality/` — anti-pattern sweeps, motion QA artifact requirements, reviewer checklists.
- `research/` — deep dives like glassmorphism, modern UI libraries, and animation dossiers.
- `inspiration/` — tagged gallery of production-grade references to pull from.
- `workflow/` — implementation checklist, PR expectations, and adoption workflows.

Everything is Markdown; edit freely, cite sources when you add research, and update the Field Guide whenever you create or move files.
