# Modern UI/UX Reference (Engineering Edition)

A condensed field guide for engineers who need to ship cinematic, high-trust web interfaces without resorting to ad‑hoc styling. The focus here is on *why* each technique matters, *how* to implement it, and which failure modes to avoid. Examples reference the Promptly control room UI, but the guidance generalizes to any modern dashboard or tool.

This guide is broken down into the following sections:

*   [1. Layered Foundations](./01-foundations.md)
*   [2. Surfaces, Depth, and Hierarchy](./02-surfaces.md)
*   [3. Layout System](./03-layout.md)
*   [4. Motion & Feedback](./04-motion.md)
*   [5. Content Modules](./05-content-modules.md)
*   [6. Accessibility, Resilience & Tooling](./06-accessibility-resilience-tooling.md)
*   [7. Anti-Patterns to Avoid](./07-anti-patterns.md)
*   [8. Implementation Checklist](./08-checklist.md)
*   [9. Conclusion](./09-conclusion.md)
