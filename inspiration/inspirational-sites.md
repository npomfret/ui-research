*   **Bold Minimalism:** Many top designs pair a clean, minimalist aesthetic with bold, expressive typography. This creates a strong visual hierarchy and a high-end feel.
*   **Micro-interactions:** Small, purposeful animations that respond to user interaction are a key component of modern web design. They provide feedback, guide the user, and make the interface feel alive.
